# RFID Attendance System
Itâ€™s a web based attendance application for a university setting in which attendance is taken with an RFID card. There are three types of users in this application admin, faculty and student.

Admin can add new users like faculty and student and can perform all CRUD operations on users. Admin can also add new courses and can perform all CRUD operations on courses. Lastly Admin can also enroll faculty and students in any course and admin will also be able to perform all CRUD operations on enrollments.

Faculty will be able to see their courses and will be able to create sessions to be held in each of his course and perform all CRUD operations on sessions.

Students will be able to see their courses and will be able to see their attendance status for each course.

A student must have an RFID card for marking his/her attendance. Attendance will be marked by tapping the card on an RFID scanner which will be connected to a computer system.
